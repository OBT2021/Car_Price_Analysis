# Car_Price_Analysis
I explored how factors like brand, fuel type, transmission, and mileage influence car prices using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
ðŸš— Car Price Analysis Dashboard
ðŸ“Š An Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Car Price Insights

Overview
This project analyzes car price trends using historical data. It provides insights into how brand, fuel type, transmission, and mileage impact vehicle pricing.

Key Features
âœ… Dynamic Filters â€“ Explore data by year, brand, fuel type, and transmission.
âœ… Price Trends Analysis â€“ See how average car prices change over time.
âœ… Mileage vs. Price Relationship â€“ Understand depreciation trends using scatter plots.
âœ… Fuel Type & Transmission Impact â€“ Compare prices across different fuel types and transmissions.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- Brand â€“ Car manufacturer (Toyota, BMW, Honda, etc.)

- Model â€“ Specific car model

- Year â€“ Manufacturing year

- Engine_Size â€“ Engine displacement (L)

- Fuel_Type â€“ Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.

- Transmission â€“ Automatic, Manual, Semi-Automatic

- Mileage â€“ Total distance covered (KM)

- Doors â€“ Number of doors

- Owner_Count â€“ Number of previous owners

- Price â€“ Car selling price ($)

Tools & Technologies
ðŸ”¹ Power BI â€“ Interactive visualizations & dashboard creation
ðŸ”¹ SQL & Pandas â€“ Data cleaning and transformation
ðŸ”¹ Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn) â€“ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI file (Car_Price_Analysis.pbix).

2. Use filters at the top to explore pricing trends by year, brand, fuel type, and transmission.

3. Analyze price distributions and relationships using charts and tables.

Project Insights
ðŸ”¹ Car prices have increased steadily over the years.
ðŸ”¹ Higher mileage generally leads to a lower resale price.
ðŸ”¹ Electric and hybrid cars tend to have higher average prices compared to petrol/diesel cars.

Future Enhancements
- Adding predictive modeling for car price estimation.

- Expanding analysis with new datasets (e.g., location-based pricing).

- Enhancing dashboard visuals and interactions.
